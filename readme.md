# Migration from Teamwork to Confluence


Before running you have set your values in config.properties.

In `ignoredFiles` and `ignoredNotebooks` you specify names of files and notebooks that will not be downloaded from Teamwork.

If you have mp4 files in your teamwork you have to set JDK 1.8 (32 bit!) otherwise library used to convert mp4 files will not work.
